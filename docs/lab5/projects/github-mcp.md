Let’s see how to use GitHub MCP Server using Gordon as well as Claude Desktop in the following steps:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)


- Go to GitHub.com and sign in to your account
- Click your profile picture in the top-right corner
- Select "Settings"
- Scroll down to "Developer settings" in the left sidebar
- Click on "Personal access tokens" → "Tokens (classic)"
- Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
- Give your token a descriptive name like "Docker MCP GitHub Access"
- Select the following scopes (permissions):
 - repo (Full control of private repositories)
 - workflow (if you need workflow actions)
 - read:org (if you need organization access)
- Click "Generate token"

## Step 2: Configure the GitHub MCP Server in Docker

- Open Docker Desktop
- Navigate to the MCP Server
- Find the GitHub tool (official) card and click on it to expand details.

In your terminal, set up the GitHub token as a secret:

```
docker mcp secret set GITHUB.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=github_pat_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

For example:

```
docker mcp secret set GITHUB.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=github_pat_11AACMRCAXXXXXXxEp_QRZW43Wo1k6KYWwDXXXXXXXXGPXLZ7EGEnse82YM
Info: No policy specified, using default policy
```


If you have enabled Ask Gordon and enabled MCP Catalog (as shown in the following screenshot), then you can use docker ai command to play around with your GitHub repository.

Run the following docker ai command to create a new repository on your GitHub repo directly.


```
docker ai "create a repo called modelorbital on my github repo"

    • Calling create_repository...

The repository "modelorbital" has been created on your GitHub account. You can access it here: https://github.com/username/modelorbital

Let me know if you need help with anything else!
```

This looks great! We've successfully used Docker AI to create a new GitHub repository called "modelorbital" on your GitHub account.
