# Image Scanning with Docker Scout

## Exploring the App

The demo repository contains a Hello World Node.js application consisting of a basic HTTP server and Dockerfile pointing to a Trixie (Debian 13) base image.

The app logic is implemented in `app.js` — a minimal Node.js HTTP server that responds with "Hello World!" on the root path.

## The Dockerfile

To follow modern best practices, we want to containerize the app and eventually deploy it to production. Before doing so, we must ensure the image is secure by using [Docker Scout](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-scout/).

Our Dockerfile takes a multi-stage build approach and is based on the `node:24-trixie-slim` image.

## Build the Image with SBOM and Provenance

First, clone the labspace repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/labspace-dhi-node.git
cd labspace-dhi-node
```

Now build the image using `docker buildx` with the `--provenance=true` and `--sbom=true` flags. These options attach [build attestations](https://docs.docker.com/build/metadata/attestations/) to the image, which Docker Scout uses to provide more detailed and accurate security analysis.

```bash
docker buildx build --provenance=true --sbom=true -t <YOUR_ORG_NAME>/demo-node-doi:v1 .
```

## Scan the Image

Now that you have an image, let's analyze it. Use the `docker scout quickview` command to list all discovered vulnerabilities and Scout policy alignment:

```bash
docker scout quickview <YOUR_ORG_NAME>/demo-node-doi:v1
```

You will see output similar to:

```
 Target      │  <org>/demo-node-doi:v1              │    0C     2H     2M    20L
   digest    │  771a1b07daa3                         │

```

## Understanding the Results

As you can see, there are no CVEs at the application level, but the base image contains a number of high, medium, and low severity CVEs. Additionally, three critical policies have **failed**:

1. **No default non-root user found** — The image runs as root by default
2. **Fixable critical or high vulnerabilities found** — The base image has known fixable CVEs
3. **Unapproved base images found** — The base image is not on the approved list

This is exactly where Docker Hardened Images come into play. In the next section, we'll switch to DHI and see how these issues are resolved.
