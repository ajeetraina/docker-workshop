The **inner loop** is the iterative process of writing, building, and debugging code that a single developer performs before sharing the code, either publicly or with their team. It is typically characterized by frequent changes to the code as the developer learns more about the problem they are trying to solve.

The **outer loop** is everything else that happens leading up to release. This includes code merge, automated code review, test execution, deployment, controlled (canary) release, and observation of results. It is typically characterized by less frequent changes to the code, as the focus is on ensuring that the code is stable and ready for production..

The inner loop is often associated with the development phase of the SDLC, while the outer loop is associated with the testing, deployment, and release phases. However, the two loops are not mutually exclusive, and they can overlap in some cases.
