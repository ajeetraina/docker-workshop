## How It Works?

### Architecture Overview

When you use Docker Offload, Docker Desktop creates a secure SSH tunnel to a Docker daemon running in the cloud. Your containers are created, managed, and executed entirely in the remote environment while providing a seamless local experience.
The Process
1. Connection: Docker Desktop connects securely to dedicated cloud resources
2. Execution: Docker Offload pulls required images and starts containers in the cloud
3. Interaction: The connection remains active while containers run, supporting features like bind mounts and port forwarding
4. Cleanup: When containers stop or after 30 minutes of inactivity, the environment automatically shuts down and cleans up

### Session Management

Docker Offload provisions ephemeral cloud environments for each session:

- Environment remains active during Docker Desktop interaction or container usage
- Automatic shutdown after ~30 minutes of inactivity
- Complete cleanup of containers, images, and volumes when sessions end
- No persistent state between sessions ensures security and cost efficiency

### Cloud Builds with Docker Offload

#### Enhanced Build Performance

When you use Docker Offload for builds, the docker buildx build command executes on remote BuildKit instances in the cloud instead of locally. Your workflow remains identicalâ€”only the execution environment changes.

#### Build Infrastructure

- Isolated Environment: Each cloud builder runs on dedicated Amazon EC2 instances with EBS volumes
- Shared Cache: Accelerate builds across machines and team members with intelligent caching
- Multi-Platform Support: Native support for multiple architectures (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Secure Transfer: Build results are encrypted in transit and sent to your specified destination
- Automatic Management: Docker handles all infrastructure provisioning and maintenance

#### Performance Benefits

- Faster Builds: Powerful cloud instances outperform typical development machines
- Consistent Results: Standardized build environment eliminates "works on my machine" issues
- Resource Efficiency: No local CPU/memory consumption during builds
- Team Collaboration: Shared cache improves build times across the entire team

#### GPU-Accelerated Workloads

Docker Offload supports GPU-enabled instances with NVIDIA L4 GPUs, enabling:

- AI Inferencing: Run large language models and machine learning pipelines
- Media Processing: Handle video encoding, image processing, and graphics workloads
- General-Purpose GPU Computing: Accelerate any CUDA-compatible applications
- Hardware-Accelerated CI: Run GPU-dependent tests and validation
