# Welcome to Docker workshop

Are you tired of inconsistent development setups and slow testing environments slowing down your inner loop? This 2 hour workshop to learn the best practices, applied to an inner-loop development workflow, so you learn everything from getting set up, coding, testing and debugging your code locally without altering your existing development environment.


In this workshop, you will:

- Learn how to build, run, and debug containerized applications directly within your existing IDE, eliminating the need to switch environments.
- Discover how your IDE integrates with Docker, allowing you to seamlessly manage containerized applications throughout the development process â€“ from initial coding and testing to secure packaging and deployment.
- Learn how to spin up mock cloud services locally within containers, enabling efficient and isolated testing without complex external setups.


These hands-on labs will be a combination of theory and practical exercises.
